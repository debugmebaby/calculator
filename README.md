# Calculator

A fun, interactive web-based calculator inspired by the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. This calculator allows you to perform basic arithmetic calculations with a clean and simple interface. It’s like a little drawing of numbers and operations with every click.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
- **Simple Interface**: A straightforward calculator with a red-themed, easy-to-use design.
- **Reset**: Shake the screen to clear the current calculation and start fresh.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each button click feels like you're "drawing" a new calculation.

## How to Use
1. Click on the numbers and operations to input your desired calculation.
2. Press the `=` button to get the result of your operation.
3. Use the `C` button to clear your current input.
4. Shake the screen or press the "Reset" button to clear the entire calculation and start over.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the layout and defining the calculator’s interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling the buttons and layout with a bold red color scheme.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Handling the logic for performing calculations and clearing the display.
